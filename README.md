# ParseSNP
This program is a work in progress...
The Project was build in Visual Studio 2022, and because of the C++ 17 settings you MUST load the Solution once you open the project ie: doulbe click the SLN file.
Creating a Project will prompt for a project name this must be alphanumeic only. It in turn will become a folder under
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ParseSNP\Projects
The current DNA file will be copied there and pjoject entries saved.
To load a project go into that directory and load the ProjectManifest.ptxt
Once a project is created only the ProjectManifest.ptxt file will be updated when you save.

To delete a project entry double click it and you will be prompted to delete?

Have fune, remember it's Beta and I may not be online for a bit....

thx Robin
