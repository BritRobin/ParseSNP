# ParseSNP
Alpha code work in progress SNP viewer

This program is primarily designed to allow users to load DNA SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) from Ancestory type raw files 23tome etc. and allow search by RSID number. It will also translate some of the array specific codes to RSIDs. 

Currently, the code is very much a work in progress and whilst it may work it also may be buggy and is incomplete.

Good luck have fun
